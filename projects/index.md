## Selected Course Work & Projects

I’m building this portfolio to showcase my growth in instructional design and instructional technology.  This will be a living and breathing document- updating to demonstrate my progress through the program. 

## Genially Interactive Presentation

Genially Interactive Presentation
Completed: February 2026 | Tool Used: Genially (free web-based platform)
Discovered via: LinkedIn

I first came across Genially while doing what I naturally tend to do — scouting LinkedIn for tools that don't just support educators, but also put creative power directly in the hands of students. That dual access is what immediately caught my attention, and it's what makes Genially stand out in a crowded EdTech landscape.

As someone whose instructional philosophy is deeply rooted in Constructivism — a framework I developed and refined through years working in Gifted Education — Genially felt like a natural fit. Constructivism holds that learners build knowledge most meaningfully when they are actively creating, exploring, and making connections rather than passively receiving information. Genially embodies this in a very practical way: students aren't just consuming content, they can design their own interactive projects, collaborate with peers in real time, and express their understanding through a multimedia, click-to-explore format. The learning is in the making.

Using Genially's drag-and-drop editor, I built a fully interactive, multi-slide presentation introducing the tool to educators, complete with animations, hover effects, and embedded navigation — all without writing a single line of code. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to evaluate, learn, and effectively communicate the value of an emerging educational technology tool to a non-technical audience. I achieved this by structuring the presentation around clear instructional objectives: introducing the platform, highlighting its classroom applications, and modeling the very interactivity I was describing. As a final test of the tool's flexibility, I seamlessly embedded the completed presentation directly into this GitHub portfolio — firsthand proof of how effortlessly Genially integrates across platforms.

This work sample reflects my strengths in instructional design, technology integration, and learner-centered thinking. It shows that I don't just adopt tools — I evaluate them through a pedagogical lens. For any organization seeking an instructional designer who can connect theory to practice, identify high-value tools, and design engaging learning experiences, this project demonstrates exactly that kind of intentional, research-informed work.
