# Final Reflections: ITD-602P Instructional Technology & Design Tools

### *Every tool added to the toolbox is a win — even the ones you can't use yet.*

I came into this course with a specific goal: to build the commercial ISD toolkit I cannot access in my day-to-day work. As an Instructional Systems Designer in the Department of Defense, I work within a closed ecosystem of proprietary tools that mirror commercial platforms — but aren't them. Tools like Articulate 360 and Rise, which show up in virtually every ISD job description and portfolio outside of my sector, are simply not available to me at work. One of the reasons I enrolled in this Master's program was to close that gap.

This course did not fully close it — but it moved me forward, and I am grateful for that.

## What I Learned

Two tools stood out for me: **Genially** and **GitHub**. Neither is something I had worked with before. Genially opened my eyes to what interactive, visually engaging content can look like when thoughtfully designed. GitHub pushed me well outside my comfort zone — but building and maintaining this very portfolio through it gave me a skill I will carry forward long after this course ends.

I also noticed something unexpected: learning about tools I cannot immediately use still has real value. Each new platform I encountered sharpened my ability to evaluate tools — to ask *what problem does this solve, and does it serve the learner?* That critical lens is something I will take into every design decision I make.

Anytime I gain knowledge about a useful tool, that is a win. I genuinely believe that.

## My Biggest Challenge — and What It Taught Me

The hardest part of this course was the gap between learning a tool and being able to use it. Most of my classmates are K–12 teachers. They can introduce Genially to their students next week, iterate, and build real fluency through practice. My path looks different. The tools I learn today may not enter my daily work for months or years. That requires a different kind of patience.

It also reminded me why I am here. I am playing a longer game — building knowledge and a portfolio now so that when the opportunity comes, I am ready.

## Constructive Feedback

If I were designing this course, I would start by learning about each student's professional context. Not everyone comes in with the same access or constraints, and understanding that early would help students set more meaningful goals from the start.

I would also include at least an introductory module on Articulate and Rise. For students working toward careers in the commercial ISD sector, even a foundational exposure to those platforms would be genuinely valuable. They are the industry standard, and graduating without any experience with them puts students at a disadvantage.

## Looking Ahead

I am not waiting for a course to fill every gap. I am currently working through LinkedIn Learning courses authored by Articulate professionals — getting as close to the source as I can. It is not the same as hands-on access, but it is intentional and it is moving me forward.

As this program progresses, I am hopeful that I will gain exposure to more of the tools that define commercial ISD practice. I am also thinking more and more about translation — how the skills I have built over two years as a DoD ISD professional carry real value in the commercial world. The design rigor. The high-stakes work. The ability to perform under constraint. Those transferable skills are something I am learning to articulate more clearly.

This course is one piece of that journey. I am thankful for what I learned, and hopeful that this is just the beginning of gaining the tools I came to this program to find.
