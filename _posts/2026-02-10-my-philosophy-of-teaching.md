# My Philosophy of Teaching

### ***Aha momements are not happenstance.***

They are not accidents, nor are they the inevitable result of exposure to content. Meaningful learning occurs when teaching is intentionally designed to support how people construct understanding, engage with ideas, and apply knowledge in context. My philosophy of teaching is grounded in the belief that learning is an active, cognitive, and developmental process, and that effective teaching requires purposeful design rather than just a reliance on inspiration or technology alone.

## Learning as a Constructive Process

At the core of my philosophy is constructivism, which asserts that learners actively construct knowledge by connecting new information to prior experiences, beliefs, and contexts (Ertmer & Newby, 2013). From this perspective, teaching is not the transmission of information, but the intentional design of learning experiences that support exploration, reflection, and meaning-making.

In practice, this means creating learning environments that engage learners in authentic tasks, encourage questioning, and provide opportunities to apply ideas in meaningful ways. Without intentional structure, learners may encounter content but fail to integrate it into durable understanding. Aha moments occur when teaching supports learners in reorganizing their thinking—not when information is simply presented and expected to stick.

## Teaching for Talent Development and Engagement

*Figure 1. Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness illustrates gifted behaviors as the interaction of above-average ability, creativity, and task commitment (Renzulli, Reis, & Smith, 2021).*

My experience with teaching the gifted and talented population further informed my philosophy with Dr. Joseph S. Renzulli’s talent development framework, which emphasizes that high-level learning and performance emerge from the interaction of above-average ability, creativity, and task commitment (Renzulli et al., 2021). This model reframes teaching as the intentional cultivation of conditions that foster deep engagement and sustained effort.

From this lens, teaching is not about identifying who is capable of learning, but about designing environments that invite learners to commit to complex thinking. When instruction is purposeful, challenging, and relevant, learners are more likely to persist, reflect, and experience insight. Conversely, when learning lacks meaning or coherence, disengagement often reflects a design problem rather than a learner deficit.

Aha moments, therefore, are the result of teaching that aligns challenge with support and creates space for learners to invest cognitively and creatively in their learning.

## Cognitive Clarity and Multimedia Design

*Figure 2. Multimedia learning principles illustrating the importance of managing cognitive load through intentional instructional design (Mayer, 2020; Wikiversity, n.d.).*

While engagement and challenge are essential, learning is also constrained by cognitive capacity. Richard E. Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning provides a critical foundation for my teaching decisions, emphasizing that learners process information through limited visual and auditory channels (Mayer, 2020). Instruction that overwhelms these channels can impede learning rather than enhance it.

This research reinforces my belief that effective teaching requires cognitive restraint. More content, more visuals, or more technology do not automatically lead to deeper understanding. Instead, teaching should prioritize clarity, coherence, and alignment between instructional goals and instructional methods. Multimedia elements should be used only when they directly support learning and reduce extraneous cognitive load.

Aha moments are most likely to occur when learners can focus their cognitive resources on sense-making rather than navigating unnecessary complexity.

## Teaching with Intention

Taken together, constructivist learning theory, Renzulli’s talent development model, and Mayer’s cognitive theory underscore a central principle of my philosophy: effective teaching is intentional. Insight does not emerge spontaneously; it develops through carefully designed learning experiences that balance challenge, engagement, and cognitive support.

Aha moments are the product of:

- Purposeful learning experiences

- Opportunities for active engagement and reflection

- Instructional clarity and coherence

- Sustained cognitive effort supported by thoughtful teaching


Teaching, therefore, is a design-oriented practice that shapes the conditions under which understanding can emerge.

## Conclusion

My philosophy of teaching is grounded in the belief that learning is constructed, not delivered. As I previously stated, aha moments don’t just happen—they are intentionally designed. Effective teaching requires thoughtful planning informed by learning theory, talent development, and cognitive science. You simply cannot throw spaghetti on the wall and hope that understanding will emerge.

Teaching demands purpose and coherence. When learning experiences are deliberately structured to support active meaning-making, sustained engagement, and cognitive clarity, learners are far more likely to develop durable understanding. By grounding teaching decisions in constructivist principles, Renzulli’s talent development framework, and Mayer’s research on multimedia learning, I strive to design instruction that removes unnecessary barriers and guides learners toward insight.

Ultimately, teaching is the practice of creating the conditions in which learning can occur. When instruction is intentional, aligned, and grounded in research, learners are not left guessing what might stick—they are supported in constructing understanding that lasts.
