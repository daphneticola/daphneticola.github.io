## 

I am an Instructional Systems Designer with professional experience designing
learner-centered, performance-driven instructional solutions.

This website serves as a professional portfolio highlighting selected course
work, design exercises, and reflections developed as part of my Master of
Science in Instructional Technology and Design (MSITD), as well as my ongoing
instructional design practice.

The examples included here demonstrate my approach to instructional design,
learning theory application, and problem-solving in real-world contexts.
